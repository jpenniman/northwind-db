# Northwind Sample Databases

Sample databases for working with microservices based on the orginal Northwind sample database from Microsoft.

## The Databases

There are 5 databases carved out of the original:

1. customer-db
2. order-db
3. catalog-db
4. inventory-db
5. shipping-db

## DBMS Systems

Currently, the databases are provided for MySQL 5.x and hire in the form of mysqldump files.

## Schemas and Users

The scripts also create the database/schema and users/owners for each database.
